<h2>A mini STL performance benchmark (<a
href="stl_performance_benchmark_j.html">Nihongo, In Japanese</a>)</h2>
<h4>Sometimes a measured STL performance is needed in addition to big O
 notation information. This page has a few of such result. I hope this
 is a good starting point. Hitoshi</h4>

<ul>
 <li>Each class of C++ STL (Standard template library) has big O
     notation for the performance indicator, but the real implementation
     sometimes affected by the invisible constant factor.  Still big O
     notation helps when we choose the algorithm a lot, I was sometimes
     surprised how large this constant factor (e.g., random access
     performance of dqueue).<br>

     Therefore I sometimes measured some code performance under a
     specific environment and a specific circumstances. The effect of
     constant factor is depends on problem size and environment. Before,
     I just made such programs and trash them. However, even its depends
     on the problem and environment, I found those results are useful
     and put this to somewhere on the Web space. If you want to use
     this, you need to compare your problem and environment, and adjust,
     or re-measure the performance when you needed.
     <strong>This benchmark is just a starting point. If you didn't
     aware the difference between your problem and this code, this only
     generate garbage.  </strong> Although, I hope this measurement
     shown here would be useful to start with. All the source code are
     also available in this page for your adjustment. Hitoshi

<h2>Benchmark result</h2>

<h3>Environment</h3>
<ul>
 <li>CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2720QM CPU @ 2.20GHz
 <li>OS: 3.2.0-29-generic #46-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jul 27 17:03:23 UTC
     2012 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
 <li>Compiler: gcc (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.6.3-1ubuntu5) 4.6.3
 <li>Compiler option: <code>-O6 -DNDEBUG -fomit-frame-pointer
     -fexpensive-optimizations -fschedule-insns2 -finline-functions
     -funroll-loops -fPIC -march=native</code>
 <li>Elapsed time is measured by <code>gettimeofday()</code> system
     call. The source code is <a href="StopWatch.hh">
     <code>StopWatch.hh</code></a>
 <li>The resulting numbers may of course differ depends on various
     reasons. For instance, if your CPU is faster, the result may
     differ. These are just indicators.
</ul>

<H3>
<code>std::map</code> creation and copy (<code><a
href="perf_map_copy.cpp">perf_map_copy.cpp</a></code>)
</H3>
Number of iterations = 100000 and averaged elapsed times are shown.
<table border="1">
 <tr>
  <td>Key size</td>
  <td></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>50 keys</td>
  <td>14 micro seconds (1.4x10<sup>-6</sup> sec)</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>100 keys</td>
  <td>33 micro seconds (3.3x10<sup>-6</sup> sec)</td>
 </tr>
</table>
Comment: I have a function that consumes a few millisecond. I use
std::map to report the resulting status. Now I know the status report
doesn't cost too much. I was afraid this copy took most of the time. I
also bind this creation and copy to boost::python. The overhead is one
more copy and creation to get information to python interpreter. (boost
1.48)

<H3>
Median computation: nth_element() vs sort() (<a
href="perf_nth_element.cpp"><code>perf_nth_element.cpp</code></a>)
</H3>

Number of iterations = 100000. (each operation is performed 100000 times
the elapsed times are shown.)
<table border="1">
 <tr>
  <td>Array size</td>
  <td>sort</td>
  <td>nth_element</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>4096</td>
  <td>4.20 sec</td>
  <td>1.18 sec</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>8192</td>
  <td>8.98 sec</td>
  <td>2.30 sec</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>16384</td>
  <td>19.2 sec</td>
  <td>4.59 sec</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>32768</td>
  <td>40.9 sec</td>
  <td>9.32 sec</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>65536</td>
  <td>88.1 sec</td>
  <td>18.7 sec</td>
 </tr>
</table>
Comment: I need to compute median for a rather small array. The
nth_element is faster as expected.

<H3>
Performance comparison between <code>set</code> and
<code>hash_set</code>. (<a
href="perf_set_hash_set.cpp"><code>perf_set_hash_set.cpp</code></a>)
</H3>
Number of items = 1000000. (One million insertion, then one million find
test, then remove test.) The elapsed times are shown.
<table border="1">
 <tr>
  <td>Method</td>
  <td>set</td>
  <td>hash_set</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>insert()</td>
  <td>7.31 sec</td>
  <td>922  millisec</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>find()</td>
  <td>4.95 sec</td>
  <td>255  millisec</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>erase()</td>
  <td>2.12 sec</td>
  <td>301  millisec</td>
 </tr>
</table>
Comment: If you see the input sequence in the code, it is just a
continuous sequence. This is quite artificial sequence. You should test
on your typical input sequence. My preference is set() although all the
result is slower than hash_set. Since you can fool any hash function and
you can find quite pathetic case, even randomized method. Instead of
that, set has less surprise. Actually, our customer is good at to find
the pathetic case. We can fix somehow the pathetic case of hash
function, but, we don't know our customer could find another unexpected
pathetic case. If our software has a similar bug many times, then, our
relationship between customer becomes worse.
